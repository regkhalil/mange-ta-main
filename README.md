# Mange ta main

Mange ta main is a Streamlit application for exploring recipes, their nutritional profile, and popularity signals. The project combines data preprocessing pipelines with analytic modules (complexity, ingredient health, nutrition scoring) to help users discover dishes aligned with their preferences and dietary goals.

## Quick start

- **Requirements**: `uv` for Python dependency management and `make` for utility tasks.
- **Run the development server**: `make dev`

The `make dev` target launches the Streamlit app with dependencies resolved by `uv`, enabling fast iteration on dashboards and analytic modules.
